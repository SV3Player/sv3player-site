## Overview

SV3 Player is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to external servers.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
All data is stored locally on your device:
- Server credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain
- App preferences are stored in UserDefaults
- No data is sent to SV3 Player servers (we don't have any)

### What We Store
- Server URLs and authentication tokens for your media servers
- App preferences (theme, display settings)
- Optional: Cached thumbnails for performance

### What We Don't Store
- Video content
- Watch history (stored on your media servers, not in the app)
- Personal information
- Analytics or usage data

## Third-Party Services

SV3 Player connects directly to your configured media servers:
- Stash
- Plex
- Emby
- Jellyfin
- Custom GraphQL endpoints

Your credentials and data are transmitted directly between your device and your servers. We have no visibility into this communication.

## Network Communication

The app only communicates with:
1. Your configured media servers (to fetch and stream content)
2. Apple's App Store (for app updates and optional tips)

## Children's Privacy

SV3 Player is not directed at children under 17. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our GitLab repository.
