## Your Content. Your Control.

SV3 Player is a vertical-first video player designed for your self-hosted media libraries. Swipe through your collection the way you want — without algorithms deciding what you see next, without engagement metrics tracking your every move, and without depending on platforms that may not be there tomorrow.
